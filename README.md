# ABOUT

These are Python scripts for use with the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/).


# INSTALLATION

Put the scripts into the *Scripts* folder which appears when you choose *Open Scripts Folder* from the *Scripts* menu.


# SCRIPTS

## LoadUFOFamily.py
Loads a family of UFOs. Choose the Regular face and all others in the same folder will loaded. Requires that files be named in __FontFamilyName-StyleName.ufo__ format. See recommendations in [Font Development Best Practices](http://silnrsi.github.io/FDBP/en-US/Font_Naming.html). At the moment, if 'Use Versions' is checked in Glyphs > Preferences > User Settings you will get error messages. Temporary solution is to turn off that feature.
